## About Tranzakt

Tranzakt is an organisation set up to be the owner of the Visual Laravel package / set of packages, 
so that these can eventually be owned and maintained by a community rather than by an individual,
a community ensuring the longevity of support and maintenance.

However, it is also the home to more general PHP and Laravel packages in the hope that these could
be maintained by the same community.

The Tranzakt community is open to anyone who wishes to contribute to the project(s),
through coding, documentation, support etc.

Anyone can fork the repos and then create and push PRs. 
Community members who demonstrate sufficient expertise to be able to review
PRs may be given specific rights to merge PRs.

Hopefully the use of the software and the community will eventually grow to the point that
it the community can be a separate, formal member of an independent 3rd party 
such as Software in the Public Interest (SPI Inc.).

## Current Projects

* Visual Laravel - a GUI-based low-/no-code code generator for Laravel. 
Will have Runtime and Development packages, 
and possibly a separate documentation repo 
to generate a documentation / help web site.

    Like Laravel itself, Visual Laravel will be built upon as much existing open source code as possible
    in order to avoid reinventing wheels,
    and will be designed to spin off as many sub-packages as possible
    in order to provide as much reuse of our code by others. 
* softDeletesUnique - a Laravel extension to allow use of Unique indexes for softDelete models.
* PHP xrange - a like-for-like generator replacement for the PHP `range` function when used with `foreach` statements

## Potential future projects

* Visual Laravel for Joomla - a Joomla extension that interfaces to Visual Laravel Runtime running in a separate web-server
* Visual Laravel for Wordpress - a Wordpress extension that interfaces to Visual Laravel Runtime running in a separate web-server
